# English-Reading-Proficiency-Calculator
Still in Project-Development Phase. Plenty of room for improvement. All the modules have been implemented, yet there's space for more. 
Any open suggestion is welcomed.

## Phases:

The model runs in basically two different phases. The FlowChart has been presented here [FLOWCHART](https://github.com/reekithak/English-Reading-Proficiency-Calculator/tree/master/Modules/Temp_file).
<br />
The Application hasn't been deployed anywhere due to high server-cost constraints & limited resources. <br />

The application is still CommandLine Based ( I've got below average Frontend-Skills ).<br />
