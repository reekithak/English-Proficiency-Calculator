# English-Reading-Proficiency-Calculator
Still in Project-Development Phase. Plenty of room for improvement. <br/>

All the modules have been implemented, yet there's space for more. 
Any open suggestion is welcomed.

## Phases:

The model runs in basically two different phases. The FlowChart has been presented here [FLOWCHART](https://github.com/reekithak/English-Reading-Proficiency-Calculator/tree/master/Modules/Temp_file).
<br />
The Application hasn't been deployed anywhere due to high server-cost constraints & limited resources. <br />

The application is still CommandLine Based ( I've got below average Frontend-Skills ).<br />


## Run the Application to test your "Reading Skills?"

### Step 1:
Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)  
Don't forget to add Path o Environment Varibales [Doubt?](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows)

Completely Optional:
Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Step 2:
Clone this Repository [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O72FWNeO-xY)

### Step 3:
From the root folder of the repository, open a commandline terminal/powershell and run the following commands:<br />

`pip install virtualenv` :- Installs Virtualenv Python Module<br />
`virtualenv ANY_NAME` :- Replace ANY_NAME with your choice of environment name<br />
`.\ANY_NAME\Scripts\activate` :- Activates the Virtual Environment we just created<br />
`pip install -r requirements.txt` :- Installs the Required Liraries , Takes time & Needs Space ("A lot")<br />

### Step 4:
Once all the Above is Completed , Lets run our Application.<br\>
Run the below command in the cmd.

`python app.py`



And let the application run its course ðŸ˜‹
